# nrf24l01-spin
---------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller driver object for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF24L01+ IC.

## Salient Features

* PASM SPI engine
* All register functionality documented in the datasheet implemented
* Basic driver test harness (blind register read/write tests - no verification yet)

## Requirements

* 1 additional core/cog (for SPI engine)

## Limitations

* API not yet stable
* No demo code, therefore no real-world functionality testing yet

## TODO

- [ ] Create some simple demos
- [ ] Enhance the test harness to include verification
